## Background
As heavy rains and flooding become more common due to climate change, scientists ad the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center set up an experiment to examine the effects of those sudden heavy rains and storm surges on forests called TEMPEST *(Terrestrial Ecosystem Manipulation to Probe the Effects of Storm Treatments)*. The data being interpreted below record percent cover of different plant species or infrastructure in each of the sixteen 5m x 5m subplots inside of three 40m x 50m main plots. Estimated plant cover from 2020, before the experiment started, is also compared against.
