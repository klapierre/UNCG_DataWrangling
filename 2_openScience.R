#### MODULE 2: Open Data, Project Management, and GitHub #### 

## OBJECTIVE:
## Know where to find data and how to bring it into the R environment.
## Set up a good file management system for yourself, which you can build on in the future.
## Branch from a GitHub repository and practice staging, committing, and pull/pushing code. 
## Create a resource to refer back to.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 1) Finding and interpreting open data.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## Go to the following website and download the full data package
## (halfway down the page): https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-knz.148.3

## Extract (unzip) the files into a folder named "YourLastName_conSME_data".


## QUESTION: Open up the file "knb-lter-knz.148.3.txt". What does this file contain?


## QUESTION: From this file, who are the dataset contributors?


## QUESTION: From this file, what are the start and end dates of the dataset?


## QUESTION: Is the data collection still ongoing?


## QUESTION: Given your answer to the previous question, why might it be good to
## have a reproducible script for data analysis related to this dataset?


# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 2) Preventing GitHub from syncing the data files.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## We can use the .gitignore file to tell git what files not to sync to GitHub!

## QUESTION: What are two reasons why we wouldn't want GitHub to sync this data?
# GitHub is not good at storing data.


## TASK: Check the Git tab in RStudio. Do you see your data folder listed added?
## Now, open the .gitignore file from the files tab in RStudio.
## Tell git to ignore the entire folder containing the data you just downloaded.
## Save the .gitignore file.


## QUESTION: What happened to the data folder listed in the Git tab of RStudio
## when you hit save?


## TASK: Stage, commit, and push your modified .gitignore file to the branch
## you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 3) Getting open data into R.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## You can import your data into R!

## TASK: Start by setting your working directory to the GitHub repository folder
## for this class on your computer using the function setwd().
## Hint - set the working directory as the top folder.


## TASK: Now we can import one of these datasets into R. Let's import the plant
## species abundance datafile (CME011). To do so, use the read.csv() function, 
## putting the relative file path and file name. Assign the dataframe you import
## a name that includes the experiment name (conSME) and the data type (abundance)
## using '<-' and be sure to carefully consider your naming convention when doing so.


## Run the following code.
conSMEcoverAlt <- read.csv("https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-knz.148.3&entityid=5716ee946efd717292fa3da9241cda7c")


## QUESTION: What did this code do? What can you say about these two dataframes?


## TASK: Check to see if the two dataframes are identical using an R function.
## (Hint: remember the Week 1 assignment?)


## QUESTION: Why might it be better to source data straight from the data portal?
## Why might it be worse?


## TASK: Save your R script. Then stage and commit (but don't push yet) your
## modified code to the branch you created for this week with an appropriate 
## commit message. Remember, it is most effective to commit small chunks of code 
## often with specific commit messages!
