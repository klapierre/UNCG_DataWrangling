#### MODULE 2: Open Data, Project Management, and GitHub #### 

## OBJECTIVE:
## Know where to find data and how to bring it into the R environment.
## Set up a good file management system for yourself, which you can build on in the future.
## Branch from a GitHub repository and practice staging, committing, and pull/pushing code. 
## Create a resource to refer back to.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 1) Finding and interpreting open data.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## Go to the following website and download the full data package
## (halfway down the page): https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-knz.148.3

## Extract (unzip) the files into a folder named "YourLastName_conSME_data".


## QUESTION: Open up the file "knb-lter-knz.148.3.txt". What does this file contain?
# It contains details about the data set about the consumer size manipulation experiment

## QUESTION: From this file, who are the dataset contributors?
# Kimberly Komatsu, Meghan Avolio, Andrew Hope, Sally Koerner, Allison Louthan, Kevin Wilcox

## QUESTION: From this file, what are the start and end dates of the dataset?
# Start Date: 01/01/2019 
# End Date: 12/31/2021

## QUESTION: Is the data collection still ongoing?
# Yes

## QUESTION: Given your answer to the previous question, why might it be good to
## have a reproducible script for data analysis related to this dataset?
# Because you can communicate data manipulations, making it easier to share analysis.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 2) Preventing GitHub from syncing the data files.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## We can use the .gitignore file to tell git what files not to sync to GitHub!

## QUESTION: What are two reasons why we wouldn't want GitHub to sync this data?
# GitHub is not good at storing data.
# If you are working in the same line of code, it could corrupt the data.


## TASK: Check the Git tab in RStudio. Do you see your data folder listed added?
## Now, open the .gitignore file from the files tab in RStudio.
## Tell git to ignore the entire folder containing the data you just downloaded.
## Save the .gitignore file.


## QUESTION: What happened to the data folder listed in the Git tab of RStudio
## when you hit save?
# It goes into the Git tab to get pushed

## TASK: Stage, commit, and pull/push your modified .gitignore file to the branch
## you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 3) Getting open data into R.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## You can import your data into R!

## TASK: Start by setting your working directory to the GitHub repository folder
## for this class on your computer using the function setwd().
## Hint - set the working directory as the top folder.
setwd(dir = "Ibrahim_conSME_data")

## TASK: Now we can import one of these datasets into R. Let's import the plant
## species abundance datafile (CME011). To do so, use the read.csv() function, 
## putting the relative file path and file name. Assign the dataframe you import
## a name that includes the experiment name (conSME) and the data type (abundance)
## using '<-' and be sure to carefully consider your naming convention when doing so.
conSME_abundance <- read.csv('CME011.csv')

## Run the following code.
conSMEcoverAlt <- read.csv("https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-knz.148.3&entityid=5716ee946efd717292fa3da9241cda7c")


## QUESTION: What did this code do? What can you say about these two dataframes?
# It created another dataframe that is seemingly identical to the one created before.

## TASK: Check to see if the two dataframes are identical using an R function.
## (Hint: remember the Week 1 assignment?)
identical("conSME_abundance", "conSMEcoverAlt")

## QUESTION: Why might it be better to source data straight from the data portal?
## Why might it be worse?
# People might update the data incorrectly, but it takes longer to paste the directory.

## TASK: Save your R script. Then stage, commit, and pull/push your
## modified code to the branch you created for this week with an appropriate 
## commit message. Remember, it is most effective to commit small chunks of code 
## often with specific commit messages!



# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 4) Thinking through your naming conventions.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## TASK: Check the names of the columns in the species cover dataset you imported.
## (Hint: remember the Week 1 assignment?)
colnames(conSME_abundance)

## QUESTION: What naming convention did the dataset creators use for column names?
# For column names, it used capitalization for the first letter

## QUESTION: What naming convention do you plan to use for this course for the
## following types of objects in R:
## R scripts:  rs_name
## vectors:  vec_name
## dataframes:  df_name
## columns within dataframes: df_col_name
## homemade functions: fun_name


## QUESTION: Do all of your objects follow the same naming convention or do you
## plan to use different naming conventions to reference different object types?
# They are the same in terms of using all lowercase and underscores, but their names will include what type of object they are.

## TASK: Save your R script. Stage, commit, and pull/push your modified code to the branch
## you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.



# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 5) Opening Issues.####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## Sometimes there are issues with code, either your own or someone else's.
## Opening issues in GitHub is a really effective way to keep track of these 
## problems.

## TASK: Create a new dataframe named "duplicates" by binding the rows of two 
## conSME dataframes you made into one using the rbind() function.
## (Hint: Very similar to the cbind function we used in the Week 1 assignment)
df_duplicates <- rbind(conSME_abundance, conSMEcoverAlt)


## QUESTION: Looking at the information for each dataframe in the environment tab
## of RStudio, what do you notice about the number of observations for the 
## duplicates dataframe compared to the two original dataframes?
# It has double the amount of the observations.

## TASK: Save your R script. Stage, commit, and pull/push your modified code to the branch
## you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.


## TASK: Open the duplicates dataframe by clicking on the file name in the 
## environment tab. Sort by Taxa, Plot, Block, Watershed, and RecDate by clicking
## on the tops of those columns in that order.
## You could also run the following code to get the same outcome:
df_duplicates[with(df_duplicates, order(RecDate, Block, Plot, Taxa)),]


## QUESTION: What do you notice about the data? Specifically, compare rows 
## 4934 and 12173 (if they are sorted correctly, those should be on top).
# They are identical.

## TASK: Save your R script. Stage, commit, and pull/push your modified code to the branch
## you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.


## It looks like we have a problem (that we created for ourselves)! Let's open an
## issue to make note of this.


## TASK: Go to our repository in GitHub through your web browser. Click on issues
## and start a new issue. Give it a descriptive title that references the script
## name and line number of the issue. Then write a comment describing the issue.


## Now let's fix our issue!
## A great function to get rid of exact duplicate columns in R is unique().
## Run the following code.
df_noduplicates <- unique(df_duplicates)


## QUESTION: Looking at the information for each dataframe in the environment tab
## of RStudio, what do you notice about the number of observations for the 
## noDuplicates dataframe compared to the dulpicates dataframe? What about compared
## to the two original dataframes?
# In the duplicates dataframe, there is 14478 obs, and in the no duplicates there is 7174 obs, in the originals there are 7239.

## TASK: Go back to our repository in GitHub through your web browser. Find the
## issue you created and resolve it.

## TASK: Save your R script. Stage, commit, and pull/push your modified code to 
## the branch you created for this week with an appropriate commit message.



# ----------------------------------------------------------
#### 6) The final push :) ####
# ----------------------------------------------------------

## TASK: Type a comment below.
# comment

## TASK: Follow these instructions carefully!
## Save your R script. Stage and commit with the commit message "learning to amend",
## but this time DON'T pull/push your modified code!

## TASK: Type another comment below.
# another comment

## TASK: Save your R script. Open up the commit window in RStudio.


## QUESTION: How many commits are you ahead of your branch on GitHub?
## (Hint: look for the message "Your branch is ahead of..." near the top of the 
## window.)
# 1

## TASK: Stage your modified code and check the "Amend previous commit" box.
## Then commit your code (still don't pull/push).


## QUESTION: What happened when you clicked "Amend previous commit"?
## How many commits is your branch ahead by now?
#1

## TASK: Once you've answered the above questions, save your R script one last time. 
## Stage your modified code, amend it to the previous commit, and finally pull/push
## your commits to the branch you created for this week.
