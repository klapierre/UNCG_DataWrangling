My data set covers research done at the Sevilleta Nation Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico from 1989-199. This research focused oin reptile populations genetic. There are 18 sites that the mark and release method was used in 6 different ecosystem. This method was used to identify and track the same individuals across the spring and summer sample sites. 
MY plan for this data set is to create a graph comparing the number of individuals in each respective ecosystem. Further I want to build a graph that represents the species density across the ecosystems as well. My first graph will show the populaiton density in each ecosystem and then the second graph wil show the species ditribution of each system.
