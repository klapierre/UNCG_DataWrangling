#### MODULE 2: Wrangle some data!                         ####               
# ---------------------------------------------------------- #

## OBJECTIVE:
# 1. To learn how to manipulate and transform data into a form usable for analysis and graphs.
# 2. To do this in a way that each step is traceable and reproducible.
# To this end we'll be familiarizing ourselves with and diving into the dplyr package.

# REMINDER: Create a new branch for this week through the GitHub website
# called yourLastName_week4. Open the Rproject for our course
# (UNCG_DataWrangling),pull any changes from GitHub, and navigate to the
# branch you created for this week in RStudio's Git tab. Open this week's
# assignment in this new branch to complete and submit on GitHub.
# Ideally, you'll commit your answers a bit at a time as you work through
# this assignment, rather than committing all at once at the end.


# The dplyr package is nested within the tidyverse package (along with many others).
# Install tidyverse and load the library. HINT: see the end of assignment #1 if you 
# forgot how to install and load a package.
