#### MODULE 2: Transform some data!                         ####               
# ---------------------------------------------------------- #

## OBJECTIVE:
# 1. To learn how to manipulate and transform data into a form usable for analysis and graphs.
# 2. To do this in a way that each step is traceable and reproducible.
# To this end we'll continue to familiarize ourselves with the dplyr package and dive into the tidyr package.

# REMINDER: In RStudio, open the Rproject for our course (UNCG_DataWrangling), 
# pull any changes from GitHub, and navigate to the branch you created for 
# yourself (just a single branch for the whole semester) in RStudio's Git tab.
# Open this week's assignment in this new branch to complete and submit on GitHub.
# Ideally, you'll commit your answers a bit at a time as you work through
# this assignment, rather than committing all at once at the end.


# REMINDER: The dplyr and tidyr packages are nested within the tidyverse package
# (along with many others). Be sure to start by loading the tidyverse library.
# HINT: see the end of assignment #1 if you forgot how to load a package.
