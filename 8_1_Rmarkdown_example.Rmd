## Background
Weather phenomenons are much more frequent in recent history due to climate change. STorms and other weather systems are intensifying and destructive weather systems are much more frequent. 
Three graphs are ued the measure the effects this change is having on ecosystems particularly the understory.


```
TEMPEST <- read.csv("TEMPEST_SERC_understory sppcomp_2021.csv")
# Select only rows of the data frame that correspond to plant species

# Subset the data frame using the is_plant vector
plant_species <- TEMPEST[is_plant, "species", drop = FALSE]
# Remove duplicate species names
plant_species <- unique(plant_species)
# Subset the TEMPEST data frame to only include treatment columns
treatment_info <- TEMPEST[, c("project_name", "calendar_year", "treatment_year", "season", "plot", "subplot")]
# Create a new column for replicate
