## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, setup1, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'C:\\Users\\louis\\OneDrive\\Documents\\UNCG\\Ecological Research') #setting working directory for all chunks
library(tidyverse) #loading tidyverse
theme_set(theme_light()) #setting a light theme for graphs
```

```{r, import, include=FALSE}
# import the data file
DF <- read.csv('TEMPEST_SERC_understory sppcomp_2021.csv')

Species <- DF %>% 
  distinct(species, .keep_all = FALSE)    # filter all unique species and delete everything else

Species2 <- Species[grepl("^[A-Z][a-z]+ [a-z][a-z]+", Species$species), ]
# ^[A-Z][a-z]+ matches the first word that starts with an upper case letter, and [a-z][a-z]+ matches the second word that starts with a lower case letter. The + indicates that the pattern should match one or more characters. The ^ and $ indicate the start and end of the string, respectively, ensuring that the pattern matches the entire string. The grepl() function returns a logical vector indicating which elements in the column match the pattern, and we use this to subset the original dataframe to keep only the desired rows.

DF2 <- DF %>% 
  mutate(workCol = paste(plot, subplot, sep= "-"))    # add a column with plot and subplot separated by '-'

DF2$plot <- ifelse(DF2$plot =="C", "control", ifelse(DF2$plot == "F", "freshwater inundation", "saltwater inundation"))         # change col plot to make them legible

TrtmtInfo <- select(DF2, plot, workCol)      # create new DF with cols plot and workCol
TrtmtInfo <- TrtmtInfo %>% 
  distinct()
```

#•	Create a rank abundance curve for the average understory plant community composition across all plots by following these steps:
#o	Calculate the average relative cover for each species across all subplots within each plot. Then calculate the average relative cover for each species across all plots. In the end you should have a data frame with two columns: species and average relative cover.
#o	Sort the data frame you created from highest to lowest relative cover. Hint: use code to do this otherwise it won't stick! Look into the arrange() function if you're unsure.
#o	Create a new column in your data frame that gives each species a rank (number from 1 to X) based on their abundance where 1=most abundant.
#o	Make a figure with points connected by lines of the rank on the x-axis and the relative cover on the y-axis. Use geom_text to label your points with the species names and be sure to give your axes intelligible labels.
