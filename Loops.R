#Loops, quite simply, loop! When a loop is run in R (or even other programming
#languages!) a block of code is run again and again, often until a specified 
#condition is met. Each time the code within a loop is run, it is refereed to as 
#an iteration.

#Loops are useful for quickly performing mundane tasks that would otherwise 
#require manual completion. 

#Different loops are useful for different scenarios. Using loops successfully 
#requires recognizing when to use different loops types. Throughout this
#assignment, we will cover three major types of loops in R: "For Loops", "While
#Loops" and "Repeat Loops".
